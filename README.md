SoundVolt
=========
**! Important: SoundVolt is down in attempts to utilize newer APIs !**
SoundVolt is a python music statistic script designed to track artist
trends on social media over a set interval of time.

###Background
This script was orignally written in 2011 before many social media API updates. Myspace, although unpopular, was still a tool used in analytics for some markets but its relevance has since been depreciated. I started reworking it again in 2014 in order to access as much analytical data as possible for music.

###Supported APIs in JSON:
- Facebook
- Twitter (OAuth required)
- Youtube
- Spotify
- Last FM

###Working on:
- Google Keywords
- Ticketmaster
- StubHub
- Flot Charts for real-time graphical updates
